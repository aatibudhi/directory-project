   <p>
     Naming core contains the core JNDI implementation. The JNDI context
     implementation is in the
     <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/naming/NamingContext.html">NamingContext</a>
     class. Context access control and thread/classloader binding are provided
     by 
     <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/naming/ContextBindings.html">ContextBindings.
     </a>Resource references, env references and links are also supported, as
     are <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/naming/SynchronizedContext.html">Synchronized
     Contexts.</a>  The <a href="./apidocs/org/apache/naming/SelectorContext.html">
     SelectorContext</a> provides dynamic delegation of JNDI operations to
     contexts bound to running threads or classloaders (set up in 
     <code>ContextBindings</code>).

 <section name="Usage">
   <p>
     This library can be used by itself to provide core JNDI services for a
     a container or standalone application, but no resource factories, xml
     configuration, JNDI URL factories or file contexts are provided in core.
