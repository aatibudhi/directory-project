<p>The Preferences dialog is the dialog used to set user preferences.   The Preferences dialog pages can be searched using the filter function. To   filter by matching the page title, simply type the name of the page you are   seeking and the available pages will be presented below. The filter also   searches on keywords such as appearance and java. The history controls allow you   to navigate through previously viewed pages. To step back or forward several   pages at a time, click the drop down arrow and a list of the most recently   viewed preference pages will appear.</p>
