<h2>Running LDAP Studio</h2>
<p>After you install (unzip) the LDAP Studio archive in a directory (such as c:\LDAPStudio), start the Workbench by running the LDAP Studio executable file found in   the top level install directory. The executable file is called   LDAP Studio.exe on Windows systems and LDAP Studio on Linux   systems. <strong>Note:</strong> the following discussion describes setting up on Windows   systems. Setup on Linux is analogous.</p>
