<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of file that is being edited, the   appropriate editor is displayed in the editor area. For example, if a .TXT file   is being edited, a text editor is displayed in the editor area. The figure below   shows an editor open on the file sample.txt. The name of the file appears in the   tab of the editor. If an asterisk (*) appears at the left side of the tab this   indicates that the editor has unsaved changes. If an attempt is made to close   the editor or exit the Workbench with unsaved changes a prompt to save the   editor's changes will appear.</p>

<p>When an editor is active the Workbench menu bar and toolbar   contain operations applicable to the editor. When a view becomes active, the   editor operations are disabled. However, certain operations may be appropriate   in the context of a view and will remain enabled.</p>
<p>The editors can be stacked in the editor area and individual   editors can be activated by clicking the tab for the editor. Editors can also be   tiled side-by-side in the editor area so their content can be viewed   simultaneously. In the figure below, editors for sample.txt and otherFile.txt   have been placed one above the other. Instructions will be given later in this   tutorial explaining how to rearrange views and editors.</p>

<p>If a resource that does not have an associated editor is opened, the   Workbench will attempt to launch an external editor registered with the   platform. These external editors are not tightly integrated with the Workbench   and are not embedded into the Workbench's editor area. </p>
<p>Also, the editors can be cycled through using the back and forward arrow   buttons in the toolbar and by using the Ctrl+F6 accelerator. The arrow buttons   move through the last mouse selection points and permits moving through several   points in a file before moving to another one. Ctrl+F6 pops up a list of   currently selected editors, by default, the editor used before the current one   is selected. (On the Macintosh, the accelerator is Command+F6.)</p>
