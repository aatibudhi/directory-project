<h2>Views</h2>
<p>Views support editors and provide alternative presentations or navigations of the information in the Workbench.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Schemas view displays all schema files in the Workbench along with their type. </li>
  <li>The Hierarchy view displays hierachically the object classes and attribute types defined in the schema files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A view might appear by itself or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="Task View" src="../images/Image3_single.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>To activate a view that is part of a tabbed notebook simply click   its tab. The Workbench provides a number of quick and easy ways to configure an   environment, including whether the tabs are at the bottom or top of the   notebooks.&nbsp;</p>
