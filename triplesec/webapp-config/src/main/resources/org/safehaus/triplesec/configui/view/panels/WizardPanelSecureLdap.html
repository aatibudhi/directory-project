    <p>
        The LDAPS (Secure LDAP) port can be enabled in addition to
        the regular LDAP port.  Note that the Triplesec Admin UI
        does not use the LDAPS port since it's communication with
        the server is local.  If you intend to administer the server
        remotely via LDAP you should enable the LDAPS port and use that.
        If a certificate does not exist on the specified path, then an
        untrusted certificate is automatically generated for you.
