      <p>
        The BER Runtime is an API for encoding and decoding ASN.1
        data structures using Basic Encoding Rules (BER).  It implements
        extentions to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/codec">
        commons-codec</a> API, for building stateful chunking encoder decoder
        pairs that maintain state between processing calls.

        More information on these new codec interfaces are availabled on the
        <a href="../asn1-codec/index.html">stateful codec</a> home page.
        You might want to read this before you continue since these extentions
        are the basis to all ASN.1 encoders and decoders.

      <subsection name="What is encoded/decoded?">
      <p>
        The BER runtime is protocol or ASN.1 module independent.  The unit of
        substrate is a BER TLV (Tag, Length, Value) so any BER based protocol
        can be decoded and encoded by the BER codec to and from TLV tuples.
