        <p>
          The perferred medium of communication is by email on the mailing lists
          however we have two IRC channels we use to track live get togethers,
          and conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of history and tracking conversations we are logging both
          channels and archiving them.  Please keep this in mind when conversing
          on these lists.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now we primarily use the dev channel for the team and basically
          ask users to take their discussions there until a user community is
          established.  The amount of chatter on both channels may be almost nil
          until the community picks up.
