    <title>Change Password Protocol Provider</title>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>The Change Password service is a protocol provider that implements <a
        href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3244.txt">RFC 3244</a> to service Kerberos Change
        Password and Set Password Protocol requests. Change Password is a request-reply
        protocol that uses Kerberos infrastructure to allow users to securely set initial
        passwords or to change existing passwords. The Change Password protocol
        interoperates with the original Kerberos Change Password protocol, while adding the
        ability for an administrator to set a password for a new user.</p>
      <p>The Change Password service is implemented as a protocol-provider plugin for the Apache
        Directory server. As a plugin, Change Password leverages Apache MINA for front-end
        services and the Apache Directory read-optimized backing store via JNDI for
        persistent directory services.</p>
      <p>Change Password, in conjunction with MINA and the Apache Directory, provides
        an easy-to-use yet fully-featured password service. As implemented within the
        Apache Directory, Change Password will provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Original Kerberos password changing service</li>
        <li>Initial password setting service (RFC 3244)</li>
        <li>Optional LDAP management</li>
        <li>UDP and TCP Support (MINA)</li>
        <li>Traffic throttling (MINA)</li>
        <li>Overload shielding (MINA)</li>
        <li>Easy POJO embeddability for containers such as Geronimo, JBoss, and OSGi</li>
      </ul>
