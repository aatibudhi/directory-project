 o need a profile for mina build to make sure we do not attempt to build 
   things that depend on jdk 1.5 when building with jdk 1.4.
 o figure out what we're going to do with sitedocs and how we're going to
   build and deploy them
 o need to designate deps as transitive verses test for most
   projects
 o the plugin list is inherited so we do not need to keep telling poms how to
   compile for jdk 1.4 - we do this all over and can delete these lines if
   we include this info in the top level pom
