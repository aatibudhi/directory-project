 o create new repository and add easymock easymockclassextension 1.2 to it
   (push to maven-snapshot-repository temporarily until we get this up on
   ibiblio).
 o get snapshots deployed to maven-snapshot-repository
 o need a profile for mina build to make sure we do not attempt to build 
   things that depend on jdk 1.5 when building with jdk 1.4.
 o figure out what we're going to do with sitedocs and how we're going to
   build and deploy them
