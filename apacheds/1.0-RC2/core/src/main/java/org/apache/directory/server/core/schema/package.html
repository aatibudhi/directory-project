    Contains interfaces for schema object registry services and simple POJO
    implementations of these services.  Other helper interfaces and classes are
    included for handling monitoring of these services.
</p>

<p>
    These services and their POJO implementations are purposefully kept really
    simple here for a reason.  When one looks at these interfaces they stop and
    think why even bother having them when you can just use a map of objects
    somewhere.  These simple services can and will get more complex as other
    facilities come into play namely the object builders that populate these
    registries.  There might also be caching going on as well as disk based
    store access.  Finally dependencies become an issue and sometime bootstrap
    instances of these components are required by the system.  So these simple
    watered down interfaces and their POJO's have been pruned from previously
    complex environment specific versions of them.
</p>

<p>
    Some key points to apply to services and their POJO impls in this package:
    <ul>
       <li>registries only register and allow for lookups: its that simple!</li>
       <li>don't worry if they change over time</li>
       <li>don't worry about how they get populated</li>
       <li>don't worry who or what does the populating</li>
       <li>don't worry about where the information comes from</li>
    </ul>
</p>
