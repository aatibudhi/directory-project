Contains interfaces and classes used for bootstrap schema object loading and
configuration.
</p>

<p>
Breifly, before delving into the reasons behind our choices, we would like to
summarize what is here.  First off each schema entity of significance whether
defined by the protocol or not is introduced into the system using a bootstrap
configuration set class.  This is a class that implements a specific interface
for creating all the needed schema objects to establish a baseline within the
system.  All such schema objects generated will be owned by the directory
administrator.  Furthermore these objects are temporary and can be overridden
in the solid state using altered versions that are authoritative definitions
within the system backend.
</p>

<p>
Just what does all this mean?  Hard coded schema objects in Java classes
which implement a configuration set interface can be loaded into the system
and used while bootstrapping it.  If this is the first time bootstrapping,
meaning these objects are NOT found within the system backend, they will
be persisted into the system backend at the very end of the bootstrap stage so
they can be resolved in the solid state.  Changes to these objects via LDAP
within the system backend by the admin persist across bootstrap sessions.  They
persist because the bootstrap object is never stored in the system backend
if a record for that object already exists.
</p>

<p>
Why are we storing a configuration directly in Java code?  First off the
likelihood of altering schema object fields to bootstrap the system is highly
unlikely.  Secondly most of these objects are published static entities and
changing them would have serious repercussions.  Hence its highly unlikely
that these objects will change and there is no need to get complex to try
to have an external representation for these schema objects.  The
representation of these objects as entries and attributes within the directory
is enough of an external representation.  Schema manipulation tools already
exist for making changes so why have another additional
mechanism/representation as well.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Baseline schema configuration sets are loaded first.
  </li>

  <li>
    Within a logical schema (e.g. krb5-kdc) the ConfigurationSets of that
    schema will be loaded in an order consistent with datatype dependencies.
    For example a ConfigurationSet (CS) for SyntaxCheckers will be loaded
    before the one for Syntaxes within the same schema.  This is because
    Syntaxes depend upon SyntaxCheckers and the proper SyntaxChecker must be
    resolvable via the SyntaxChecker registry.
  </li>

  <li>
    A CS shall contain schema objects associated with a specific owner, and a
    specific logical schema.  The set of CS schema objects may depend on
    Schema objects within other logic schemas, hence other CS objects.  These
    dependencies on other logical schemas are exposed by the CS interface.
  </li>

  <li>
    Other user defined CS classes can be loaded by the system as well.  The
    system can search on the classpath for classes implementing the CS
    interface.  It would then need to analyze dependencies to determine which
    schema object sets to process/load first.  This is the most rudimentary
    of mechanisms for users to introduce new schema objects into the system.
    The other means is during the solid state through LDAP itself.  Changes
    can be made along with new schema object introductions via schemaSubentry
    changes in the usual LDAP manager where schema objects are attributes in
    a massive entry.  Another means is through the alteration of easier to
    manage entries for schema objects through the system namespace.  Changes
    to either schemaSubEntry attributes or system namespace schema entries both
    mirror one another.  A change to one propagates to the other: the same
    entity is being manipulated through two different views.  One is a heck of
    a lot more manageable.
  </li>

  <li>
    We can add a resolver interface so a resolver can be registered after
    bootstrapping with a registry.  In the case of a registry miss we ask the
    resolver for the object.  If it cannot find it then well we're out of luck.
    Once the resolver is set for solid state operation, registry misses make
    the resolver go to disk on the system backend for authoritative copies.
  </li>

  <li>
    The resolver concept mentioned above can itself be another registry.  It's
    just a secondary disk registry used when the first misses disk.  So hence
    other registries should be able to be registerable with others to allow for
    registry delegation like the way classloaders delegate.  This way there is
    no need to replace bootstrap registries.  Once they have enough info to
    enable disk access, they can tap secondary schema information on disk to
    override the bootstrap objects first of all.  Secondly in the solid state
    schema objects can be brought into memory from disk.
  </li>
