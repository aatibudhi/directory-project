      <p>
        We wanted to keep the networking code as independent as possible to
        prevent it's concerns from creeping into the LDAP protocol handling
        code.  Furthermore we wanted it to be independent of the LDAP protocol
        so it can be reused as much as possible with other protocols.
      </p>

      <p>
        This lead to the creation of a newtorking framework or two.  These
        frameworks use different approaches and models to provide the network
        plumbing needed by internet protocol servers.  A common protocol
        provider API is used to implement protocols enabling the provider on
        all network frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each network framework at the directory project has its own project so
        its best to delegate a description of each framework to the appropriate
        project documentation:
