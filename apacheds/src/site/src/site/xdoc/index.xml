      <p>Welcome to the Apache Directory Server Homepage!</p>

      <p>
        The Apache Directory Server is an embeddable LDAP server written in
        Java.  It has been designed to introduce triggers, stored procedures,
        queues and views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich
        constructs.
