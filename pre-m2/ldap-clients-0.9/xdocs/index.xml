    <title>Apache Directory Project: LDAP Client</title>
  </properties>
  
  <body>
    <section name="Overview">
      <p>
        The goal of the LDAP Client package is to provide access to any
        LDAP server "over-the-wire".  These clients will perform the following
        operations:
        <ul>
          <li>Bind</li>
          <li>Add</li>
          <li>Delete</li>
          <li>Modify</li>
          <li>ModifyDN</li>
          <li>Search</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section name="Command Line Clients">
      <p>
        There will be a traditional command line set of clients.  These are Java 
        so will be platform independant.  The command line clients will also come 
        with a set of wrappers for Unix/Linux and Windows so the Java specific paths
        and arguments will be abstracted away.  The users will only need to provide
        the command line arguments specific to the LDAP operation.   
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section name="Client Libraries">
      <p>
        The client package will also include a set of library methods to embed
        LDAP clients into an application.  Each of the operations in the command
        line will be able to be performed in the library.  This will be used for
        application that wish to connect over the wire to an LDAP server.  Many
        of the LDAP specific details, such as parsing LDIF's have been handled.  
        The application will not have to worry about dealing with LDAP specifics.
