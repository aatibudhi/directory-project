                           ====================

The Directory project is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by Noel Bergman. Incubation is required of all
newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.

For more information about the incubation status of the Directory project you
