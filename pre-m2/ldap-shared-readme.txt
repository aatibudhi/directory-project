Some significant tags have been deleted but may be resusitated or checked out 
by copying them back or exporting them using a revision number.  Here we list 
those tags within the repository for future reference.  This is done to keep 
the project root checkout lean, so only those branches in use should be 
present.

notes: 
    Looks like this may have been some kind of reverse engineering effort
    Robb Penoyer tried to do with Snacc4J.  It may have been in the sandbox and
    put here.  Regardless we definately do not need it.
