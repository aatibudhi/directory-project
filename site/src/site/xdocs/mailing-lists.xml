    A mailing list is an electronic discussion forum that anyone can subscribe
    to. When someone sends an email message to the mailing list, a copy of that 
    message is broadcast to everyone who is subscribed to that mailing list. 
    Mailing lists provide a simple and effective communication mechanism. With 
    potentially thousands of subscribers, there is a
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">common set of etiquette
    guidelines</a> that you should observe.</p>

  <section name="The lists">
    <subsection name="The Directory Developers and Users List">
      <p>
        All mail and concerns are managed via one list per incubator project. 
        Although we left the incubator we're not discriminating between users and developers yet. 
        As long a traffic is not extremely high, we will keep it as is.
      </p>      
      <p>
	<em>Light Traffic</em>
<a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@directory.apache.org">Subscribe</a>
<a href="mailto:dev-unsubscribe@directory.apache.org">Unsubscribe</a>
<a href="http://www.archivum.info/dev@directory.apache.org/">Archive</a>
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="The Directory SVN List">
      <p>
        This is kind of a misnomer.  We use subversion but the change 
        notification still uses cvs since we were originally going to use CVS
        but switched to SVN.
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>Medium Traffic</em> 
<a href="mailto:commits-subscribe@directory.apache.org">Subscribe</a>  
<a href="mailto:commits-unsubscribe@directory.apache.org">Unsubscribe</a>  
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes to the Directory Subversion repository are echoed to this list.
