        Stefan's main focus is end user experience for the LDAP server. 
        One of his goals is to make the Apache Directory Server behave as an arbitrary LDAP client would expect.
        Therefore he started to create a test suite for black box and regression testing.

      <subsection name="Some Background">
      <p>
	    Stefan Zoerner lives with his family near Hamburg, Germany. 
	    He collects ancient postcards and Sun workstations and likes to write IT related articles (about LDAP topics, sometimes).
	    In May 2004, Stefan published a German LDAP book for Java developers
	    (<a href="http://www.entwickler-press.de/buecher/ldap/">LDAP fuer Java-Entwickler</a>), 
	    the second edition appeared in November 2005:

	  <p>
	    The book itself is server independent, and Stefan was interested whether
	    the examples work on Apache Directory Server as well. This is how he found the project.

        In his commercial life, Stefan is an Advisory IT Architect at IBM e-business 
        Innovation Center in Hamburg, Germany.
