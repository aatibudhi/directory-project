        The Directory Project consists of a number of sub-projects.

              There is a set of core functionality common to all JNDI providers
              and JNDI does not necessarily revolve around LDAP and X.500
              directories.  The naming subproject will contain common JNDI code
              along with various JNDI provider's.  A J2EE ENC, environment
              naming context would be one implementation.  If you're looking to
              build a JNDI provider you might want to take a look in here before
              proceeding.

              ApacheDS' core is also a JNDI provider for the LDAP namespace.  
              This provider is not an LDAP client but operates on entries stored
              locally on disk within ApacheDS' databases.  It is a server-side 
              JNDI LDAP provider in this respect although the concept of a 
              server side JNDI provider is strange.
