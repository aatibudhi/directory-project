      <p>
        This subproject contains documents of the top level website linking 
        together all subprojects.  There are a few rules and some information
        that is needed by subproject developers in order to integrate/plugin
        their subproject documentation with this TLP website.  We cover these
        topics here.

            Changes to the subproject's Maven configuration are needed.  This
            document steps through making those changes.

            Because a separate Maven site build is used to generate subproject
            documentation and the generated documents are repositioned some
            precautions must be taken to make hyperlinks and navigations work
            properly.  This document explains the problem, and how to work 
            around it for navigations and hyperlinks.

            When changes are made to sitedocs and subproject sitedocs developers
            need to deploy those changes to the website.  This document 
            describes the way incubator projects are setup and what the process
            is for building and deploying the sitedocs for the TLP and 
            subprojects.
