<H1>Proposal for an Apache Directory Project</H1><EM>10 Sept 2003, Alex Karasulu 
(aok123@bellsouth.net) LDAPd Group Founder</EM> 
<HR>

<P>
<P>
<P><STRONG>Section 0 : Rationale</STRONG> 
<P>The geometric growth of networks, services, distributed systems, and their 
components has brought about a revival of interest in directories. Directories 
are no longer considered commodity products used to store a phone book or list 
of users. Directories and LDAP have grown into a critical technology that will 
inevitably become a cornerstone of distributed systems. Several software giants 
like BEA, SUN, and Microsoft have already demonstrated their belief in this 
outcome by heavily integrating their products with directories. Directory and 
naming systems are being used in everything from a simplified form for J2EE 
configuration to full-blown enterprise directories, within identity management 
systems and distributed computing platforms like JINI. 
<P>
<P>The overhead of managing several copies of relatively static information 
across systems and enterprises is daunting and introduces the potential for data 
inconsistency. The frequently replicated user and group tables in almost every 
database driven application alone is a testament to this fact. When multiple 
systems have to inter operate, they must share access to common information, and 
directories are the best storage paradigm for rapidly accessing this type of 
data. Whether the information to be stored, is a component's configuration, a 
user's security profile, a business rule or a business process, directories are 
the place to store it for centralized management, and distribution across 
systems. 
<P>To date, a fully compliant pure Java open source LDAPv3 server has not yet 
been written. This is partially due to the fact that a practical stateful 
protocol server in Java was virtually impossible until the introduction of the 
NIO packages in the 1.4 SDK. LDAP, as a stateful protocol, manages client state 
through a TCP socket connection. The socket connection persists through several 
client requests and server responses tying them together under a logical session 
or conversation. Before the introduction of non-blocking IO in the NIO packages 
of the 1.4 SDK, a thread had to be dedicated to each socket to detect IO. A 
stateful protocol server written completely in Java, would have needed as many 
active threads as the number of concurrent clients. Theoretically, scalability 
would have been very poor; the performance curve would be asymptotic, degrading 
rapidly with an increase in the number of concurrent connections. To scale pure 
Java statefull protocol server implementations had to wait until the Merlin 
release of the JDK. 
<P>Furthermore, no embeddable pure Java LDAPv3 server has yet been written and 
made freely available. We believe the embedding of LDAP servers into existing 
mail, application and web servers to be the next logical steps in the 
progression and integration of LDAP. Several commercial examples can already be 
sited: Microsoft Exchange and BEA Weblogic Server. The management benefits of 
coupling these servers with an LDAP server are beyond the scope of this proposal 
and left to the imagination of the reader. However, the synergy between embedded 
LDAP servers and other flagship Apache servers would lead to greater economies 
of scale for the Apache server suite and reduce the overhead of management for 
the Apache software user community. 
<P>LDAP directories are specialized databases, however unlike their RDBMS 
counterparts, LDAP directories are fairly new and for this reason lack rich 
integration features. High on the list of features lacking in LDAP servers are 
stored procedures and triggers. Triggers and Java stored procedures would expand 
the horizon of LDAP in itself even without the benefits of Java. Triggers and 
stored procedures would alleviate ugly workarounds which currently using polling 
and meta directories. These features alone would attract groups within the LDAP 
and Java communities to band together and support the Apache LDAP Project. 
<P>LDAP is both a network line protocol and a hierarchical relational database. 
Some might even argue that LDAP is object oriented. Regardless, the 
implementation of an LDAP server is not a trivial matter. LDAP code bases 
written in native languages have to be ported to run on different platforms. 
Conditional complies in C based implementations were shown to considerably 
reduce the maintainability of code bases. The complexity of a database, a 
network line protocol and conditional compilation together have resulted in 
reduced maintainability for C based LDAP servers. Also the learning curve and 
hence barrier to entry for developers is greater. These complications would not 
exist for a Java based LDAP server that is written once and can run anywhere. 
<P>The Apache Foundation supports several component container projects which 
provide the proper foundation for a Java LDAP directory server. Apache also 
supports several server side application containers which can realize 
significant functional enhancements by employing an LDAP directory server. Also 
LDAP requiring organizations today must settle for less than optimal 
implementations and often have to pay as high as a dollar per entry to directory 
enable their applications. The Apache LDAP Project would solve these problems by 
providing a free robust LDAPv3 implementation in a standalone configuration or 
an embeddable configuration for use in all Apache servers and other third party 
products. 
<P>Our goal is to produce a community of developers with backgrounds in LDAP, 
X.500, Database Engineering and JNDI tasked with the development of pure Java 
LDAPv3 Clients, APIs, JNDI providers and LDAPv3 compliant servers with the 
aforementioned features. The produced software will be ASF licensed. Where 
applicable the best available ASF/BSD licensed code will be reused and new code 
will be added to complete the LDAPv3 protocol as defined in <A

<P>
<P><STRONG>Section 0.1 : Criteria</STRONG> 
<P>We feel that this project has a good chance for success as the following 
project aspects are carefully considered : 
<P><EM>Meritocracy:</EM> The project will be meritocratic - the usual Apache 
meritocracy rules would apply. 
<P><EM>Community:</EM> The user community for this project is potentially 
massive. The initial developer community for this project consists of developers 
from Apache and LDAPd projects. The aim is for this community to grow 
considerably once this project enters the incubator. 
<P><EM>Core Developers:</EM> The initial developers are listed further below 
within this document and consist of some existing Apache committers together 
with committers from the LDAPd Group. 
<P><EM>Alignment:</EM> There is clear alignment with many existing Apache 
projects. From Jakarta projects such as Tomcat, James and Slide for embedding 
LDAP. The LDAP DSML standards will eventually require the use of several XML 
projects. Other projects like OpenJms<A 
href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?action=edit&amp;id=OpenJms">?</A>, 
which currently are not Apache projects but very well may be in the future will 
be used for things like replication. Jdbm likewise is used for building Btree 
based indices for custom databases. Also projects like Apache Xindice may be 
leveraged for an XML based backend or for DSML enabling subsystems of an LDAP 
server. 
<P>We see the Apache Directory Project as a separate project to existing Apache 
projects, serving several roles 
<UL>
  <LI>Home for Apache Directory Client APIs and Client Scripts 
  <LI>Home for Apache JNDI Providers for Various Directory Namespaces 
  <LI>Home for Apache Directory Servers 
  <LI>May also become home to an ASN.1 Encoding/Decoding<A 
  href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?action=edit&amp;id=ApacheDirectoryProject/Decoding">?</A> 
  Library </LI></UL>
<P>
<P><STRONG>Section 0.2 : Warning Signs</STRONG> 
<P>We feel this project has a good chance for success as the following warning 
signs do not apply to the project we are proposing: 
<P><EM>Orphaned products:</EM> This project is starting with an existing code 
base which using lots of the high quality open source code out there which is 
ASF/BSD licensed. 
<P><EM>Inexperience with open source:</EM> The initial community is made up of 
existing Apache and LDAPd Group committers exclusively so the open source 
experience is there to varying degrees. 
<P><EM>Reliance on salaried developers:</EM> None of the initial developers are 
currently paid to work on the Directory Project. 
<P><EM>No ties to other Apache products:</EM> The Apache Directory Project is 
complementary to existing technologies at Apache. LDAPd currently uses Avalon 
and will eventually be used by james. LDAPd will eventually integrate into 
Geronimo. The Apache Directory Project will integrate with, and possibly 
subsume, Jakarta Commons Naming. 
<P><EM>A fascination with the Apache brand:</EM> The committers are interested 
in developing a healthy open source community around ASF/BSD licensed directory 
servers and their clients along with other JNDI accessible name spaces. Is 
Apache the right place? We think it is. Several Apache folks have already shown 
interest in LDAPd, the seed code base to be used for this project. In fact the 
LDAPd Group was initially approached by Apache to submit an Incubator proposal. 
LDAPd Group members voted unanimously to donate the code to Apache in an effort 
to build the next flagship server at Apache and much more. 
<P>
<P><STRONG>Section 1 : Scope of the Project</STRONG> 
<P>There are multiple goals for this Apache project: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Promote a healthy open source community! 
  <LI>Promote a language agnostic environment for both client side and server 
  side endeavors. 
  <LI>A one stop location for all directory and naming needs on any platform or 
  any language. 
  <UL>
    <LI>client APIs 
    <LI>clients 
    <LI>JNDI providers for Java and other namespaces. 
    <LI>May also include an LDAP protocol correctness and stress testing suite 
    in the future. </LI></UL>
  <LI>Provide servers in embeddable configurations. 
  <LI>Provide servers in standalone configurations as UNIX daemons or NT 
  Services. 
  <LI>Provide support for Directory Server embedding or integration with 
  existing Apache servers like httpd, Slide, Tomcat, James and Geronimo. 
</LI></UL>
<P>
<P><STRONG>Section 2 : Initial Source</STRONG> 
<P>The initial code base from which to create the Apache Directory repository is 
contained mostly at Sourceforge under the LDAPd project accessible <A 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ldapd">[here]</A>. This code base must 
assign copyright to the Apache Software Foundation. The code base will need to 
be licensed under The Apache Software Foundation license. The license file in 
every subproject will be changed to the Apache license. The current license is 
already an Apache "style" license, so this change is basically a change to name 
The ASF as the owner. 
<P>The proposed TLP (after incubation) would have an one or more directory 
servers with multiple datastore backends, a JNDI context for J2EE configuration, 
JNDI service provider(s) for LDAP and other transports, State and Object 
Factories suitable for use in the various Context/DirContext<A 
href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?action=edit&amp;id=ApacheDirectoryProject/DirContext">?</A> 
implementations, etc. 
<P>Beside source code the LDAPd Group must transfer its IANA assigned ASN.1 
Object Identifier to Apache Software Foundation.
