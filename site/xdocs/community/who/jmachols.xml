        Jeff is one of the original members of the LDAPd group founded by 
        Alex Karasulu. He came into the Apache Software Foundation when it 
        absorbed the LDAPd source code and members.

      <p> 
        Jeff had the good fortune of becoming associated with Alex Karasulu 
        at a pivotal time early in 2002. Alex had some frustrations with LDAP 
        due to deficiencies in all of the servers he used and was toying with 
        the idea of writing one. Jeff's initial role was simply to serve as a 
        sounding board for ideas. As time went on and he heard not only the 
        ideas but, the passion of Alex about this endeavor, Jeff eagerly
        accepted Alex's invitation to become involved in the LDAPd project.

        Jeff's primary focus on the project is the client side of LDAP. After a 
        struggle implementing Unix user authentication with other LDAP servers 
        and clients, he saw additional opportunity for improvement. The goal of 
        the client and LDAP common sub-project is to provide a set LDAP tools 
        to match the ease of use, flexibility and rich features of Eve.

        Jeff's also worked closely with the Apache Infrastructure team, 
        especially Noel Bergman, to import the LDAPd CVS source code into 
        Subversion. The Apache Directory project was one of the first to 
        implement Subversion.
