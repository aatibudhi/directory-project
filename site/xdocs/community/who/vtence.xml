        Vincent was starting to work on a security project at sourceforge when he met Alex. Alex was interested in security
        in the context of the LDAPd project. Soon after, LDAPd moved to become the Apache Directory Project. 
        Later, Alex and Vincent decided to join forces and Vincent joined the Apache Directory Project team
        to work on the security subsystem.
