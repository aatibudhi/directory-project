      Welcome to the Directory community!
     </p>
     <p>
      The Apache Directory Project, like all other projects at Apache, 
      is a <em>meritocracy</em> and follows the <em>Apache Way</em> of
      community and project management.  The following documents
      help define these terms and form the guidelines by which the 
      Directory Project operates.

    <section name="Opening up the Directory Project's Repositories">
      <p>
        The Directory Project continually looks at ways to cooperate 
        better with other projects, especially here at Apache.
        Code reuse by us and others using our APIs is one of our
        primary goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are from another Apache project, and would like all the
       committers from your project to have access to the Directory
       Repositories, all you need to do is ask the Directory PMC
      </p>
       <p>
         The PMC will let you know if your request is accepted or
         not. If you are interested in commit privileges, but are not
         part of one of the Apache projects, then you have to do it
         the old fashioned way and participate on the mailing lists
         and post patches, etc. We are taking advantage of the Apache
         infrastructure to make this happen.
