Here is a list of things that has to be done :

 * write tests !
 * add the streaming of big objects
 * deal with memory exhaustion
 * extend a DER and CER decoder from the BER decoder
 * add JMX manageability
 * start to think about how this can be use in the ASN.1 compiler
 * - ... (add your TODO !)

 
Things in progress :

 * describe the inner mechanism on wiki, explaining the choices
 * start to think about PER
 * write a tester that eat some XML and do the decode. (Being able to encode,
   then decode and having the same result means that the codec works)
