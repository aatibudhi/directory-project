	    Emmanuel discovered Apache Directory Server 9 months ago, while 
	    looking for alternatives to commercial LDAP directories and to the excellent 
	    but non java-based OpenLDAP. He found this project very exciting and 
	    promising and jumped on it.

        Emmanuel is living and working in Paris - France since 1988.
          
		Since then, he has been working on a X400 messaging  system, where he first met with ASN.1. 
		He developped a meta-directory above X400 MHS and also got involved on 
		a variety of IT projects. He heard about Java in 1996, when it was just a 
		buzz, and waited until 2000 to cut his teeth on it.

		Emmanuel is at the moment mostly involved in the Twix sub-project. Twix is 
		the third ASN.1 BER codec used by Apache Directory Server. Its goal is to be 
		a much faster codec than Snickers, and a first step toward a complete ASN.1 codec generator. 
		As with Snickers, it's a  <b>non-blocking</b>, <b>event-driven</b> codec.
      
		Both Codecs are pluggable in ApacheDS simply by modifying the configuration file.           
          
		Emmanuel has also started working on a LDAP proxy which is actually being developped actively by Jocelyn Dodin.
